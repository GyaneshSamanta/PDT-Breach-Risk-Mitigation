# PDT Breach Risk Mitigation

This repository contains the code and resources for the "PDT Breach Risk Mitigation" project. The project aims to assess and mitigate risks associated with data breaches using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In the age of big data, breaches of sensitive information pose significant risks to individuals and organizations. This project focuses on building a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of data breaches and suggests possible risk mitigation strategies. The goal is to help organizations proactively identify and manage potential security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Includes notebooks and scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict breach risk.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing data trends, model performance, and breach risk insights.

## Model Explanation

The core of this project revolves around building a machine learning model to predict the risk of data breaches. The key steps involved in the model development process are as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    - Data was collected from multiple sources, including historical data breach records and related cybersecurity datasets.
    - The data was cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - New features were derived based on domain knowledge and data insights. This included creating risk-related metrics and aggregating information from different sources.
    - Feature selection was performed to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task.

3. **Model Selection**:
    - Various machine learning models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).
    - After comparing model performance, Random Forests and GBM were selected for their ability to handle complex interactions and provide robust predictions.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - The selected models were trained on the processed data and evaluated using cross-validation.
    - Performance was measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model performance.

5. **Model Interpretation**:
    - Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand which factors most influence the breach risk predictions.
    - Visualization techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, were used to explain individual predictions and the overall model behavior.
